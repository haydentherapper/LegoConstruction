It sounds like this week has been productive for you.  Hopefully the research you've done is sufficient and you won't have to do much more of it.  I think optimizing your syntax to make implementation easier is a good way to go with this.  I don't think you're losing a lot from the end-user's perspective, and you're certainly making your life easier.

I'm not sure I quite understand the question about Part and Color vs Piece, but the tab example sounds fine to me.  It isn't much harder to parse, even for a non-programmer, I think.  And it seems to make it a lot easier for you to implement, like I said.

I think I would have to see a larger example with the new syntax to fully evaluate, but, again, this seems fine.  I don't think the curly braces make it much harder for a layperson to understand how to use this language.  A layperson might not understand the significance of the curly brace in particular (or that it usually significes scope), but I feel like they would pretty easily understand they are grouping some statements together.  It might be a good idea to try to get some non-programmer perspectives for this, and you should certainly keep evaluating if you need to make more changes to your syntax, but I think what you have now will work fine.
