It sounds like you made a lot of progress this week, so nice work. The issue I had was understanding your example, which I know you were worried about. Mostly, I'm not sure why some x's are larger than others. I believe the top row is the 6x1 piece, supported by the 2 1x1 pieces, but I am not sure where the 2x2's are in the diagram. Are they the smaller x's? 

I think I agree with the change to something like B1 vs 2,1. That seems easier to understand to me.

Relating to the z-axis problem, you could do something like move all segments down one space before moving on. If something cannot move down, revert to the last full move. That seems to be the simplest to me, though easier said than done. Let me know if this doesn't make sense.

Finally, I think it is important to, like you said, focus on the core product. A lot of this looks really cool, but may take too long to implement (ie supporting positioning by naming regions on the grid).

Good luck!
