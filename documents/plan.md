# Project plan

## Language evaluation
How will you know that your language has accomplished its goals? What tools, techniques, or measurements will you use to evaluate your language design? What tools or practices will you use to ensure that your language implementation is of high quality?

I want my language to be used. First, I would love to give my tool to the Lego subreddit and find out if the language is usable. My main worries is verbosity: How can I minimize the amount of input needed? I want to get input from designers. 

## Implementation plan
How much time do you think you'll need for the various components of your language (e.g., finding a host language, implementing the semantics, the parser, tools, etc)? Provide a brief schedule (e.g., with a deliverable every week) for your project.
